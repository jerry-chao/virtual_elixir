# Tasks: Virtual P2P Service Cluster

**Feature**: Virtual P2P Service Cluster  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-virtual-cluster-p2p/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature follows TDD approach - tests will be included in appropriate phases.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Elixir code: `lib/` directory
- Python CLI: `python_cli/` directory
- Paths shown below assume single project structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Stories 1-3 (P1) can proceed in parallel after foundational phase OR sequentially
  - User Stories 4-5 (P2) depend on foundational phase and may depend on US1-3
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for deployed services to migrate
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for services to route
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 with intelligent scheduling
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Can work independently but benefits from services (US1)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (included for TDD) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, US1, US2, US3 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Tasks within a story marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Integration test for service deployment in tests/integration/test_service_deployment.exs"
Task: "Contract test for service deployment API in tests/integration/test_service_deploy_contract.exs"
Task: "Unit test for service scheduler in lib/virtual_cluster/scheduler_test.exs"
Task: "Integration test for multi-node scheduling in tests/integration/test_scheduler_multi_node.exs"

# Launch foundational setup in parallel:
Task: "Create ServiceScheduler GenServer in lib/virtual_cluster/scheduler.ex"
Task: "Implement bin-packing algorithm in lib/virtual_cluster/scheduler/bin_packer.ex"
Task: "Implement Docker container deployment in lib/virtual_cluster/docker/deployer.ex"
Task: "Create service registry in lib/virtual_cluster/registry/service_registry.ex"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Deploy a service, verify it runs on one of the machines
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic service deployment!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (With failover!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (P2P access!)
5. Add User Story 4 & 5 ‚Üí Polish and monitoring
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Deploy Service)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Failover) - needs US1 partially complete
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P2P Access) - needs US1 partially complete
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 85
- **Setup Phase**: 7 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 15 tasks
- **User Story 1**: 13 tasks (9 implementation + 4 tests)
- **User Story 2**: 12 tasks (8 implementation + 4 tests)
- **User Story 3**: 12 tasks (9 implementation + 3 tests)
- **User Story 4**: 5 tasks (4 implementation + 1 test)
- **User Story 5**: 6 tasks (5 implementation + 1 test)
- **Polish Phase**: 12 tasks

- **Suggested MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1)
  - Total: 35 tasks
  - Delivers: Basic service deployment capability

- **Parallel Opportunities**: 
  - 7 tasks in Setup can run in parallel
  - 10+ tasks in Foundational can run in parallel
  - Tests and some implementation tasks within each story can run in parallel
