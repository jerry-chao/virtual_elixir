# Security Audit: Virtual Cluster

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Initial Assessment

## Authentication & Authorization

### Token Management (JWT)

✅ **Implemented**: Token-based authentication for:
- Machine cluster membership
- User service access
- Service-to-service communication

✅ **Security Measures**:
- Tokens signed with cluster secret key
- Expiration configured (24 hours default)
- Scope-based access control
- Secret stored in environment variable (not hardcoded)

⚠️ **Recommendations**:
- Rotate cluster secret periodically
- Use HTTPS for token transmission in production
- Implement token revocation mechanism
- Consider adding refresh tokens

### Network Security

✅ **Implemented**: 
- Token-based cluster membership (machines require valid token to join)
- P2P connection security via WebRTC encryption
- NAT traversal using STUN/TURN

⚠️ **Recommendations**:
- Use VPN for sensitive data in production
- Enable TLS for all external communications
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints

## Data Protection

✅ **Implemented**:
- Data replication across 2+ nodes (redundancy)
- Service isolation via Docker containers
- Resource constraints enforced

⚠️ **Recommendations**:
- Encrypt data at rest (use encrypted filesystem)
- Implement backup encryption
- Add data retention policies

## Security Best Practices

### Current Implementation

1. ✅ No hardcoded secrets
2. ✅ Token expiration enforced
3. ✅ Scope-based access control
4. ✅ Container isolation
5. ✅ Resource limits enforced

### Additional Hardening Needed

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all deployment configs
2. **Container Security**: Scan images for vulnerabilities
3. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate cluster traffic
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all administrative actions
5. **Secret Rotation**: Implement periodic token rotation

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

1. **Unauthorized Cluster Access**: Mitigated by token authentication
2. **Data Loss**: Mitigated by replication across nodes
3. **Service Compromise**: Mitigated by container isolation
4. **Denial of Service**: Partially mitigated by resource limits

### Recommended Controls

1. Network firewalls
2. Container security scanning
3. Regular security updates
4. Monitoring and alerting
5. Incident response plan

## Compliance Notes

- GDPR: Data can be processed locally (complies with data residency)
- No external data transmission without explicit consent
- User data isolation per service

## Conclusion

Current implementation provides **basic security** suitable for development and testing. For production deployment, additional hardening measures should be implemented as outlined above.
